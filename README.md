===================

What is it
---------------
A collection of PHP classes and files I've developed for personal projects that helps you start your project very quickly.

How to use it
---------------
1. go to `app\Classes\Config.php` and edit the switch cases. 
 - example: `local, localhost, local.dev website.com`
2. go to `config\app.php` and edit your configuration.
3. include the `core/init.php` at the top of all your pages.
